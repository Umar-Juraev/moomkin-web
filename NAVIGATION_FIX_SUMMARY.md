# Navigation Localization Fix

## Problem
Navigation was causing 404 errors because routes like `/hot` and `/trends` were not properly localized. The app expects localized routes like `/uz/hot`, `/en/hot`, `/ru/hot`, etc., but components were using non-localized paths.

## Root Cause
Components were using regular Next.js `Link` and `useRouter` instead of the localized versions from `next-intl`. This caused navigation to routes without the locale prefix, resulting in 404 errors.

## Solution Applied

### Updated All Components to Use Localized Navigation

**1. Header Component (`src/components/layout/Header.tsx`)**
- Replaced `import { useRouter } from "next/navigation"` with `import { useRouter } from "@/i18n"`
- Replaced `import Link from "next/link"` with `import { Link } from "@/i18n"`
- Updated logo link from `href={`/${locale}`}` to `href="/"`

**2. Products Component (`src/section/Products/Products.tsx`)**
- Replaced `import Link from "next/link"` with `import { Link } from "@/i18n"`
- Updated trend link from `href={`/trends`}` to `href="/trends"`
- Updated hot link from `href={`/hot`}` to `href="/hot"`

**3. Search Component (`src/components/shared/Search/Search.tsx`)**
- Replaced `import { useRouter } from "next/navigation"` with `import { useRouter } from "@/i18n"`
- Router navigation now automatically handles localization

**4. Page Components**
- **Search Page**: Updated breadcrumb links to use localized Link
- **Products Page**: Updated breadcrumb links to use localized Link  
- **Favorites Page**: Updated breadcrumb links to use localized Link
- **Discount Page**: Updated router navigation to use localized router

**5. Settings Module (`src/modules/Settings.tsx`)**
- Replaced `import { useRouter } from "next/navigation"` with `import { useRouter } from "@/i18n"`
- Updated navigation from `router.push(`/${locale}`)` to `router.push("/")`

### Key Changes Made

**Before (Non-localized):**
```typescript
import Link from "next/link";
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation";

<Link href="/hot">Hot</Link>
router.push("/favorites");
```

**After (Localized):**
```typescript
import { Link, useRouter } from "@/i18n";

<Link href="/hot">Hot</Link>  // Automatically becomes /uz/hot, /en/hot, etc.
router.push("/favorites");    // Automatically becomes /uz/favorites, /en/favorites, etc.
```

## How It Works

The `next-intl` navigation helpers automatically:
1. **Add locale prefix**: Routes like `/hot` become `/uz/hot`, `/en/hot`, `/ru/hot`
2. **Handle locale switching**: When user changes language, routes maintain the same path structure
3. **Preserve query parameters**: Search params and other URL parameters are maintained
4. **Work with middleware**: The middleware automatically handles locale detection and routing

## Result
- ✅ All navigation now properly localized
- ✅ No more 404 errors on routes like `/hot`, `/trends`, `/favorites`
- ✅ Language switching works correctly
- ✅ Breadcrumb navigation works properly
- ✅ Build successful
- ✅ Consistent navigation experience across all languages

The application now properly handles localized navigation, ensuring all routes work correctly regardless of the selected language.
